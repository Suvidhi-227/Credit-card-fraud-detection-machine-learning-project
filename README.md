# Credit-card-fraud-detection-machine-learning-project
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms—logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and isolation forests—to detect credit card fraud. After preprocessing the dataset with feature scaling and splitting into training and test sets, each model is trained and evaluated  confusion matrices and classification reports.
