# Credit-card-fraud-detection-machine-learning-project
This project utilizes machine learning algorithms—logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and isolation forests—to detect credit card fraud. After preprocessing the dataset with feature scaling and splitting into training and test sets, each model is trained and evaluated  confusion matrices and classification reports. 
Project Title
Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Isolation Forest

Description
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions by employing multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and isolation forest. The project leverages supervised and unsupervised approaches to accurately classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent, comparing model performance to determine the most effective algorithm.
